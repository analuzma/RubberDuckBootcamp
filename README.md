# Instructions:

1 Use W,A,S,D, your arrow keys and your spacebar to move around and jump.
2 You must do as the "order" on the screen says. For example "jump" (you should jump)
3 An order can become negated if it has an exclamation point on the beggining, which makes the order negated and you should not do it. "!jump" (do should NOT jump).
